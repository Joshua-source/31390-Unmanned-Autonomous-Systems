# PART 1: Rotations
### Exercise 1.1
Find the rotation matrix corresponding to the set of Euler angles ZXZ. Describe the procedure used to find the solution.
### Exercise 1.2
Discuss the inverse solution for the Euler angles ZYZ in case sθ = 0.
### Exercise 1.3
Discuss the inverse solution for Roll-Pitch-Yaw angles in the case cθ = 0.
### Exercise 1.4
Given a pair of unit vectors v and w (v =from and w =to, find the minimal rotation that
brings v in w.
(SUGGESTION: use your knowledge on axis-angle representation)
### Exercise 1.5
Answer the following questions with explanations:

• What is the quaternion q1 that represents the rotation of 180 degree about the x-axis?

• What is the quaternion q2 that represents the rotation of 180 degree about the z-axis?

• What rotation is represented by composite quaternion q = q1q2? Answer by specifying
its rotation angle and axis.

### Exercise 1.6
Compare the number of additions and multiplications needed to perform the following op-
erations:

• Compose two rotation matrices.

• Compose two quaternions.

• Apply a rotation matrix to a vector.

• Apply a quaternion to a vector (as in Exercise 4).

Count a subtraction as an addition, and a division as a multiplication.
